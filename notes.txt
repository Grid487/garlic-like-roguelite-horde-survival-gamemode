Duplicates turn into "Fragments" to upgrade the item's star level.
There will be 5 yellow star levels and another 5 red / carnage star levels.
to transcend a 5 yellow star item to a 1 carnage star, you need gold, fragments, and carnage essences (can be obtained from killing enemies post 10 mins.)
excess fragments can be turned into gold.

IDEAS: 
 
1. CSGO Weapon Crate
--> RARITIES
Crates have rarities, a rare crate will only offer weapons of rarity rare and up (no uncommon and below).

combination tbl_gl_elements:

|POISONED + ON FIRE| -> release GAS EXPLOSION, damage reduction raised to 65%.
- poisons enemies.
- already poisoned enemies have their stacked damage number multiplied by x1.1

|ON FIRE + ELECTROCUTED| -> enemy gets burnt by blue fire for 3 seconds. (refreshable)
- blue fire deals damage every 0.2 second.
- blue fire deals 30% of player max health as damage.

|ON FIRE + ELECTROCUTED + POISONED| -> sends out poison lightning bolts to nearby targets
- on hit, create a GAS EXPLOSION.
- 1 second cooldown (stored in the player attribute).

every time the player releases the alt key a brief showcase of the weapon's print name and stats shows on the right hand side of the screen for 3 seconds.
   
2. Ultimate Skill
Active skills that can be activated with Mouse3.

etc. ideas:
 
- random totems / statues appear in the map giving temporary boosts (damage, defense reduction, mana regen boost etc)
- chance for enemies to drop booster entities (damage, xp, damage reduction)
